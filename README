csvkit
======

A library of utilities for working with CSV, the king of tabular file formats.  Inspired by pdftk.

THIS CODE IS VERY ALPHA.

Projected list of utilities:

in2csv - converts fixed-width, xls, xlsx, odf, and dbf files into csv (like ogr2ogr)
csvcut - extends Joe Germuska and Aaron Bycoffe's CSV splicing/munging tool
csv2sql - generates a sql create table statement for a CSV using type inference (in particular for use with the COPY command in postgres)
csvtest - validates that a CSV does not contain mixed datatypes and other anomalies
csvsummary - generates summary statistics for columns in a CSV (like R's summary() function)
csvjoin - quickly merge two CSV files by a shared column

All tools will write to STDOUT and therefore support piping, such as:

in2csv data.xls | csvcut -f 0,2 | csvsql
