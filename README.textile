h1. csvkit

A library of utilities for working with CSV, the king of tabular file formats.  Inspired by pdftk.

*THIS CODE IS VERY ALPHA*

h2. in2csv

Converts various formats into csv. Currently supported: fixed-width and xls (Excel).

Converting fixed width requires that you provide a schema file with the "-s" option. The schema file should have the following format:

<pre>
column,start,length
name,0,30
birthday,30,10
age,40,3
</pre>

The header line is required and must match exactly.

All output from in2csv is written to standard out.

Example conversion of fixed-width file:

<pre>
./in2csv -s examples/textfised_schema.csv examples/testfixed > testfixed.csv
</pre>

Example conversion of xls file:

<pre>
./in2csv examples/test.xls > testxls.csv
</pre>

h2. Projected list of utilities:

in2csv - convert fixed-width, xls, xlsx, odf, and dbf files into csv (inspired by ogr2ogr)
csvcut - extension of Joe Germuska and Aaron Bycoffe's CSV splicing/munging tool
csv2sql - generate a sql create table statement for a CSV using type inference (in particular for use with the COPY command in postgres)
csvtest - validate that a CSV does not contain mixed datatypes and other anomalies
csvsummary - generate summary statistics for columns in a CSV (like R's summary() function)
csvjoin - quickly merge two CSV files by a shared column

All tools will write to STDOUT and therefore support piping, such as:

in2csv data.xls | csvcut -f 0,2 | csvsql
