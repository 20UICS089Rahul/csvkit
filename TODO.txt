Bugs:

Best practice:

Factor main functions of tools into library and test them
Factor argparse parser's to use "parents" argument for base options
Add documentation for using csvkit as a library

Features:

Expand functionality of csvtest (mixed-type column warnings)
Implement Brian's crazy/awesome csvsql "insert" idea (hard with sqlalchemy)
XLSX support (really, really hard to get right)
DBF support

New utilities:

csvdiff: identify which rows/cells have changed
csvjoin: quickly merge two CSV files by a shared column
