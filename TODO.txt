Bugs:

Normalize whitespace stripping across importers
Normalize ints with leading zeroes to strings (careful of 0!)
Unicode support (-e, --encoding flag)

Best practice:

Test command-line interfaces? (Factor argparsing out of main so args can be mocked)
Have normalize_column_type also return nullable and max_length?
Factor existing utilities to use abstracted normalize_table method

Features:

Implement csv.Sniffer to auto-detect dialect
csvlook: print to console in R/psql style fixed width table?
csvdiff: identify which rows/cells have changed
csvtest: validate that a CSV does not contain mixed datatypes and other anomalies
csvsummary: generate summary statistics for columns in a CSV (like Râ€™s summary() function)
csvjoin: quickly merge two CSV files by a shared column
