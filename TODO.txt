Bugs:

Best practice:

Factor main functions of tools into library and test them
Have normalize_column_type also return nullable and max_length?
Factor existing utilities to use abstracted normalize_table method

Features:

Implement csv.Sniffer to auto-detect dialect
Implement Brian's crazy/awesome csvsql "insert" idea
Expand functionality of csvtest

New utilities:

csvlook: print to console in R/psql style fixed width table?
csvdiff: identify which rows/cells have changed
csvsummary: generate summary statistics for columns in a CSV (like Râ€™s summary() function)
csvjoin: quickly merge two CSV files by a shared column
