================================
Working with standard Unix tools
================================

Summary
=======

The utilities in csvkit have been designed to mimic the function of standard Unix text processing tools, such as head, grep and sed. This means that, to the furthest extent possible, they will:

* accept input on STDIN (i.e. via pipe)
* write output to STDOUT
* behave properly when a list of files is provided as input (e.g. via glob)

This page contains a list of common Unix utilities that csvkit works well with and some examples of how to use them.
