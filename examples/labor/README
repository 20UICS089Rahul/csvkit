Files in this directory have been problematic for the toolkit.

Specifically, 
% csvclean -d \| ar_disbursements_emp_off_data_2002.txt
produces the error file, and then the error file has ragged row lengths.  So, csvclean shouldn't be creating output with ragged rows, but also, maybe csvclean could be smarter about what it read and fix what appears to be quoting problems...

Maybe I should try running csvclean with a noquoting behavior and if that works, promote that to a CLI option...
